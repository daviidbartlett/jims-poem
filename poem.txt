A poem about Jim

Jim is a very lovely man with very lovely hair,
He likes to drink coffee but watch out for his stare.
He has really cool glasses and a lovely orange jumper,
His favourite character from disney's Bambi is the rabbit Thumper.

The Ballad of David and Jim

Docent David delights in delivery,
of learned lectures throughout long weeks.
While Jim Jabbers Jargonisations,
Tha send students straight to sleep.
